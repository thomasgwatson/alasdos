The organization that backs the youth group, <a href=\"https://www.steppingstonesproject.org/\">The Stepping Stones Project</a> is focused on rites of passage and developing our relationships to community and nature. Their model begins with this premise; many industrialized societies have forgotten or lost the ceremony and structure around teenage rites of passage. There are deep and rich traditions of marking the transitions of our life in some areas (such as funerals and weddings). However, the marking of a transition from childhood to adolescence is sorely missing in the lives of many youth coming of age today. Stepping Stones seeks to change that. This leads to my next topic.</p>\n<h6>Masculinity for 21st century</h6>\n<p>In my eyes, masculinity (male gender roles) needs to be updated. And certainly not in the revisionist, retrograde fashion that some folk suggest. As intersectional feminism continues its push for multi-generational change in the roles and possibilities for women and equality for all, some men have been triggered by the uncertainty of change and the resetting of power dynamics. Operating under a scarcity mindset, from a place of fear and of understanding the world in zero-sum game terms (more for someone else, automatically means less for me), these men (and some women) yearn to return to ‘simpler’ times when gender roles were more or less fixed. I seek to articulate and build new masculinities (plural!), that adapt and integrate intersectional liberation of all people.</p>\n<h6>How humans get things done</h6>\n<p>This is probably my broadest topics, used as a catch all for my general fascination with how people come together, and how they get things done together. Covering both the communal, being together aspect and the productive, coordinating, collaborating aspects of groups of humans.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ll start from here.
