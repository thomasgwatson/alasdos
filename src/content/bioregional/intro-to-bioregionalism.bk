Bioregionalism: plan for our time together

- Where do we begin? (Miro board input)
  - How much do you think you know about bioregionalism
  - Word association

- Definition
- Confusion
- Developing your bioregional vibe
  - Scoring session
- Bioregions at a conceptual scale
  - Big ideas
  - its placed based
  - So... whats my bioregion?
- Bioregions at a tangible scale
  - Examples from my area (implicit)
  - Examples explicit bioregionists
- Bioregionalism against the machine
  - Tensions and challenges
  - 

### My simplest definition
'political localism with ecological features'

political - bit of a loaded word. I prefer to talk about coordination (how do we coordinate?)

localism - an anchoring our focus and coordination at the local level. 
- does not preclude wider coordination
- localism by itself has been associated with 

ecological - meaning 'to have a relationship to the ecology of the place'

Done! Or at least we would be if anyone agreed with me...

#### Bioregionalism out in the world

A few years back, I summarized what you could find out about bioregionalism in a 20 minute google search. This turned up:

- Dictionary definitions
- Wikipedia articles
- The World Wilderness Fund (WWF)
- And random little explanations from odds corners of different sites (One such corner is a year 2000 post on a mailing list)

Reading through those, we arrive at an annoying conclusion

> There seem to be two different understandings of what a ‘bioregion’ is.

- One that seems purely ecological, and 
one is more like my 'simple' definition.

#### The three elements of bioregional vibe

If we take the three key aspects of the simple definition; ecological, local and political, we can use each of those as a little scale by which to consider how 'bioregional' something is.

For example

WWF

Scoring activity

Why is the one earth schema nice?
- hierarchy
- distinct boundaries
- global


### What are some of the big ideas behind bioregionalism
- solar punk
  - chobani ad
- political identity
- ecologies don't respect borders
- cosmolocalism
- Art/literature
  - A half-built garden

### What are some dominant paradigm challenges to bioregionalism
- globalization
  - globalized supply-chains
- nationalism
- modernist extremism
- cities: how do they integrate into bioregions?
  - Yimby/Nimby; local control
- Regulation
  - Rigidity from a different logic can hinder innovation

Mission: 
- What local groups have a bioregional flavor/vibe?

Built-environment:
- how were people building in your area, one hundred years ago

SECOND SESSSSSION

Big questions (SECOND SESH)
- If bioregionalism really took off, and had some initial success, what new challenges or difficulties would it face? (What entrenched interests would it come up again?)
- If you were building an online platform to help bioregionalist organize, what features would you want to include? What about if you also wanted that platform to help people discover bioregionalism?
